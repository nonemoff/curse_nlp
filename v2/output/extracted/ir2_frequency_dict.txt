FREQUENCY DICTIONARY OF INFLECTIONAL PARADIGMS:  
CORE RUSSIAN VOCABULARY2 
 
 
 
A new kind of frequency dictionary is a valuable reference for researchers and learners 
of Russian. It shows the grammatical profiles of nouns, adjectives and verbs, namely, 
the distribution of grammatical forms in the inflectional paradigm. The dictionary is 
based on data from the Russian National Corpus (RNC) and covers a core vocabulary 
(5000 most frequently used lexemes).  
Russian is a morphologically rich language: its noun paradigms harbor two dozen case 
& number forms and verb paradigms include up to 160 grammatical forms. The 
dictionary departs from traditional frequency lexicography in several ways: 1) word 
forms are arranged in paradigms, and their frequencies can be compared and ranked; 
2) the dictionary is focused on the grammatical profiles of individual lexemes rather 
than on overall distribution of grammatical features (e.g. the fact that Future forms are 
used less frequently than Past forms); 3) grammatical profiles of lexical units can be 
compared against the mean scores of their lexico-semantic class; 4) in each part of 
speech or semantic class, lexemes with certain biases in grammatical profile can be 
easily detected (e.g. verbs used mostly in Imperative, in Past neutral, or nouns used 
often in plural); 5) the distribution of homonymous word forms and grammatical 
variants can be followed in time and within certain genres and registers. The dictionary 
will be a source for research in the field of Russian grammar, paradigm structure, form 
acquisition, grammatical semantics, as well as variation of grammatical forms.  
The main challenge for this initiative is the intra-paradigm and inter-paradigm 
homonymy of word forms in corpus data. Manual disambiguation is accurate but covers 
ca. 5 million words in the RNC, so the data may be sparse and possibly unreliable. 
Automatic disambiguation yields slightly worse results, however, a larger corpus shows 
more reliable data for rare word forms. A user can switch between a ‛basicʼ version 
which is based on a smaller collection of manually disambiguated texts, and an 
‛expandedʼ version which is based on the main corpus, the newspaper corpus, the 
corpus of poetry and the spoken corpus (320 million words in total).  
The article addresses some general issues such as establishing the common basis of 
comparison, a level of granularity of grammatical profile, units of measurement. We 
suggest certain solutions related to the selection of data, corpus data processing and 
maintaining the online version of the frequency dictionary.

1. Toward the lexicon-oriented grammar 
Some time ago, object-oriented programming revolutionized the world of computer 
technologies, software industry and the interfaces of web resources. A long list of step-
by-step instructions that automated everything was replaced with sets of objects with 
shared attributes and behavior. It is now objects that monitor the environment for events 
and trigger assigned functions. The metaphor of rules and objects can be easily applied 
to the grammar of natural language. What if the grammar is a self-organizing 
community of words rather than a general who leads the battle? What if the local 
grammars these words evoke are more efficient and powerful? Could we prove that the 
local effects are still systematic and not random? This article reports on an experimental 
frequency dictionary which aims to provide evidence to answer these questions. 
A pilot frequency dictionary shows the inflectional paradigm structure of 5000 most 
frequent Russian nouns, adjectives and verbs. It follows a series of frequency 
dictionaries based on data from the Russian National Corpus (cf. Lyashevskaya and 
Sharoff 2009, a general frequency dictionary of 50 thousand words, and online 
grammatical and collocational dictionaries at http://dict.ruslang.ru). Our lexico-
grammatical dictionary presents a comprehensive account of how inflection works, thus 
filling the gap between lexical frequency and grammatical frequency data. 
As a general practice, most frequency dictionaries present distribution of lexical data 
either at the level of tokens or at the lemma level (cf. Leech et al. 2001, Davies and 
Gardner 2010 for English, Davies 2005 for Spanish, Čermák et al. 2010 for Czech, 
Sharoff et al. in press for Russian, etc.). In addition, the number of words in different 
part of speech classes can be given. However, hardly any frequency dictionary of the 
morphologically rich languages includes information about the structure of the 
paradigm and grammatical form frequencies. The only exception we are aware of is 
Šteinfeldt 1963/1970 where the frequency of 961 Russian nouns in each case and 
number form as well as distribution of some verbs in tense and mood is calculated. 
As for grammatical frequency data, despite the fact that the task of constructing the 
frequency Russian grammar has long been recognized and promoted in the literature 
(Mustajoki 1973, Ilola and Mustajoki 1989, Baerman et al. 2010), the quantitative 
research is mostly focused on the non-lexical units: part of speech classes, grammatical 
classes (e. g. hierarchies of case marking, agreement markers, etc.), as well as 
morphemes (Šajkevich et al. 2008).  
Our project shifts the focus from the distribution of grammatical classes and categories 
to particular word forms as structured by the inflectional paradigm. Of particular 
concern are words with certain biases in grammatical profile, e.g.  
• verbs used mostly in the imperative;  
• verbs never used in the past neutral;  
• nouns used often in the plural;  
• nouns with low rate of the nominative forms, etc.  
The dictionary will be a source for many of the future research in the area of Russian 
grammar, paradigm structure, grammatical semantics, as well as variation and 
alternation of grammatical forms (Graudina et al. 1976). It will provide a detailed 
account of gradual nature of some important phenomena such as singularia and pluralia 
tantum. Data from the RNC provide a great opportunity to answer many research 
questions, taking into account current technologies of corpus linguistics.

This article presents a short introduction in the structure of Russian paradigms (Section 
2), examines the background to the lexico-centric approach to the frequency grammar 
(Section 3), discusses various types of information available in the dictionary (Section 
4), and some issues associated with the processing and interpretation of the frequency 
data (Section 5 and Conclusion). 
2. The structure of Russian paradigms 
The data set in the dictionary is based on the morphological standard of the RNC 
(Lyashevskaya et al. 2005) which generally follows the paradigm inventory developed 
in the grammatical dictionary (Zaliznjak 1974). The dictionary takes into account only 
single-word forms, not paraphrastic forms such as, for example, the conditional forms 
with the particle by, imperfective future and passive participle construction with the 
auxiliary byt’ ‘to be’, analytical forms of the comparative degree, etc. 
The paradigm of Russian nouns has up to 17 cells: two grammatical numbers multiplied 
by six major cases (the nominative, the genitive, the dative, the accusative, the 
instrumental and the locative) plus five minor forms which some words take in the 
singular: the so-called ‘second’ genitive, the ‘second’ accusative, the ‘second locative’, 
vocative, and the adnumerative.  
The adjectival paradigm has at least 32 cells: 26 inflected long forms (three genders in 
the singular and the plural multiplied by six cases; in addition, the masculine and the 
plural adjectives distinguish two types, animate and inanimate, of accusative forms), 
four short forms (three genders in the singular and the plural), and two comparative 
forms. Zaliznjak’s grammatical dictionary (Zaliznjak 1974) and the morphological 
standard of the RNC excludes from the standard paradigm some archaic short forms 
with case endings and the superlative forms which has the same declension as the full 
forms. Russian pronouns and numerals function either as nouns or as adjectives.  
There is a considerable syncretism within the nominal paradigm. Some case forms are 
fairly homonymous, e.g. the accusative and the nominative forms of inanimate nouns, 
the accusative and the genitive forms of animate nouns (except for the feminine singular 
that has six distinct case forms), the genitive, dative, instrumental and locative forms of 
many adjectives in the singular, etc. 
The paradigm of verbal forms has less cohesion among its forms than the declension of 
nouns. Imperfective and perfective verbs are considered to be separate lexical units and 
have slightly different paradigm structure. The non-past forms express present tense for 
imperfective verbs and future tense for perfective verbs and distinguish three 
grammatical person and two numbers. Past tense has four forms, three genders in the 
singular and the plural. Imperative forms distinguish first and second person, and 
singular and plural, plus a minor inclusive form. The non-past and past forms are 
usually used in the active-middle voice; passive forms formed with the reflexive –sja 
affix are almost non-existent but potentially double the number of indicative forms. The 
imperfective has two gerunds for present and past tense, whereas perfective verbs form 
only the past gerund. Imperfective verbs can have up to four participles (the present 
active, past active, present passive and past passive participles), whereas perfective 
verbs have two (the past active and past passive participles). Each participle can have a 
full complement of twenty-four adjectival full forms and four short forms. The infinitive 
has only one form and is a basic dictionary form of the verb.  
 
3. Why mean frequencies may not always help 
 
4
When linguists talk about the frequency grammar they presumably refer to a specific 
type of quantitative data like the frequency ratio of part of speech classes, frequency 
hierarchy of cases and other grammatical categories. The topic of case-frequency 
distribution is particularly popular in Russian linguistics: Kopotev 2008 cites three 
studies that were published during three years in 1959-1961; and there are much more 
recent publications that report research results based on various digitized text samples. 
Kopotev 2008 draws attention to the stability of frequency data in large and small 
corpora (cf. Table 1). The first two sets of data are based on the modern corpora (RNC 
and HANKO) while the two others are drawn from the earlier frequency dictionaries 
based on datasets smaller than 0.5 MW. Kopotev concludes that the modern corpora 
agree quite well in the assessment of mean probability of case occurrences, and the 
differences lie in the structure of text collection in terms of genres.

However, the principle ‘choose genitive if not sure’ may easily mislead if a student of 
Russian as a foreign language has to choose an appropriate case for the word shepot 
‘whisper’. Table 2 shows that the frequency distribution of cases within some nominal 
paradigms deviates significantly from a typical pattern.

As early as in 1974 J. Greenberg proposes a hypothesis that different semantic groups 
may have different distribution of cases (both with prepositions and without them; 
Greenberg 1974/1991). Choice of Russian as an object of study is not accidental: his 
hypothesis testing is carried out on the data from the aforementioned frequency 
dictionary (Šteinfeldt 1963, source corpus 0.4 MW). Greenberg classifies one half of the 
nouns into twelve categories (animal, body parts, time periods, etc.) and calculates the 
average frequency of each group for each case. As expected, the place names are used 
mostly in the accusative and locative form while the dative shows a higher value in

personal pronouns (1st and 2nd person), see Table 3. However, not every episode is 
explained that easily.

Table 3. The relation of Russian case frequencies to semantic features (adopted from Greenberg 
1974/1991: 210). 
 
(Rice and Newman 2005) and (Newman 2005) make the observation that the 
distribution of grammatical variation may be present within the lexical groups. They 
focus on the notion of inflectional islands (or the skewedness of the frequencies of 
certain inflectional forms according to the corpus data), and their source corpus is BNC. 
Rice and Newman notice that the frequencies of English think, know and mean at the 
inflectional level is very different even though the meaning of three verbs appear very 
similar. They claim that the large inflectional islands help to gain insight into what is 
believed to be semantic differences.  
The concept of grammatical profile is introduced in (Janda and Lyashevskaya 2011) as 
the relative frequency distribution of the inflected forms of a word in a corpus. On the 
one hand, it presents a more elaborated version of Rice and Newman’s ideas for rich 
inflectional paradigms that involves many forms and complex grammatical 
 
6
oppositions3. On the other hand, it follows the behavioral profile approach proposed by 
(Divjak and Gries 2006) as a tool to study the semantic and functional reasons for 
discrepancies of corpus frequencies. Whereas Divjak and Gries indiscriminately take a 
vast range of morphological, syntactical, lexical and semantic factors and build the 
hierarchical structure based on their contribution to the frequency patterns, the 
grammatical profile explores only inflectional data. Our study of aspect, tense, and 
mood forms in (Janda and Lyashevskaya 2011) shows, inter alia, the predictable 
frequency effects in the imperative form of the imperfective verbs that refer to a frame 
of being a guest. The imperatives do not provide new information, but rather express 
standard polite formulae such as razdevajtes’ ‘take off your coat’), sadites’ ‘sit down’, 
zakusyvajte ‘eat chasers’, zakurivajte ‘please smoke’, etc. The infinitive perfective 
forms are often used with the verbs like vospolnit’ and sootnesti, which in turn prefer 
the constructions with tentative verbs and adverbs describing the difficulty or 
importance of an achievement. 
(Kuznetsova 2013) studies the ratio of the masculine and feminine forms used in the 
past. Kuznetsova analyses the class of typically ‘feminine’ and typically ‘masculine’ 
verbs: whereas verbs of sewing, knitting, embroidery, darning and so on are associated 
with feminine forms, verbs that describe being a leader or negatively evaluated behavior 
like drinking or spitting are found in a ‘masculine’ list (see Table 4).

What is most surprising about the Russian lexical system is that there are no nouns such 
that their grammatical profile would correspond to the ‘average’ profile of the 
substantives, verbs with the ‘average’ proportion of tense-person-number forms and so 
                                                 
3 The grammatical profile approach was also applied to Old Slavonic data (Eckhoff Janda 2013). See also 
(Janda et al. 2013) on constructional profiles and radial category profiles, (Janda and Lyashevskaya to 
appear) on semantic profiles and (Kuznetsova 2013) on collostructional profiles, the other quantitative 
approaches to explaining the RNC data developed by the CLEAR group at the University of Tromsø.

on. In order to make Greenberg’s hypothesis work, we must assume that when we 
explore the lexical space we deal with multiple overlapping classes, complex 
superposition of semantic features, syntactic and structural properties. All this 
collectively affect the frequency output. 
Greenberg was looking for the 'magic' ratio, which would allow the word to refer to a 
particular semantic class; no wonder that he never succeed to find it. Now, from the 
viewpoint of cognitive semantics, his observation can be reinterpreted as a semantically 
motivated shift of grammatical forms frequencies. Let us take three examples. A high 
ratio of the instrumental case forms in the paradigm of the noun shepot ‘whisper’ can be 
explained as the overlap of the lexical semantics (whisper as a way of speaking) and the 
semantics of its grammatical form (the instrumental of manner). The overlap between 
the stative semantics of the noun poza ‘posture’ and the semantics of placement in the 
locative prepositional group v ‘in’ + S.loc explains the peak on the locative case forms, 
cf. v poze (lotosa) ‘in the lotus position’. The nouns that refer to path/trajectory are most 
typical fillers of the prepositional group po + S.dat ‘along (a path)’, and hence there is 
prevalence of the dative forms in the noun tropinka ‘walking path’.  
 
4. Frequency information in the dictionary 
4.1. Small and expanded dataset 
There are two sets of frequency data in use in the dictionary. The ‘small’ version is 
based on the manually disambiguated subcorpus and contains more accurate annotation 
from the point of view of grammatical homonymy. However, since the subcorpus is as 
small as 5 MW, the chance to meet some rare grammatical forms is very low or they do 
not occur at all. As a result, if a particular word form is not frequent, its distribution 
within the paradigm may not be reflected properly in the ‘small’ version. 
The ‘expanded’ version is based on the collection of four RNC corpora which is 60 
times larger than the manually disambiguated subcorpus. The disambiguation of 
lemmas, part of speech and grammatical features is done by the computer, so the 
attribution of homonymous tokens (e. g. the accusative form that mirrors the genitive 
animate form) is less reliable. Both versions are imperfect but the user can choose 
between them according to the task at hand. 
4.2. The level of granularity of grammatical profile 
The most detailed level of granularity available in the data is not necessarily the most 
optimal one. Given the number and structure of forms, grammatical profiles can be 
shown at varying levels of resolution.  
The user can evaluate certain grammatical distinctions for their relevance for his/her 
research task and collapse them within the grammatical profile. For example, there can 
be a cluster of full passive participle forms within the verbal paradigm (distinction in 
case, number, gender and animacy is collapsed), a cluster of four forms of the past tense 
(distinction in number and gender is collapsed), a cluster of all singular forms of the 
noun as opposed to a cluster of all plural forms (distinction in case is collapsed).  
As a move in the opposite direction, the grammatical profile of nouns can be extended 
with the distributional pattern of prepositions which are used with each case. This is 
done since the research practice suggests that the most fine-grained level of inflectional 
profiling is not enough: when the case forms are used alone, or used with different 
prepositions, their meaning and syntagmatics change dramatically.

4.3. Homonyms and grammatical variants 
The user can restrict the output to the relevant subset of grammatical forms. Two look-
up tables are pre-defined: a subset of inflectional forms that have a homonym within or 
outside the paradigm (see Ventsov, Kasevich 2004 on intra-paradigm and inter-
paradigm homonymy in Russian) and a subset of graphically distinct variants of a 
grammatical form. The dictionary shows: 
1) the ratio of graphically identical forms within one paradigm, e. g. soldat ‘soldier’, 
Nom. sg. VS Gen. pl. VS Acc. pl., and 2) the ratio of each homonymous forms that 
belongs to the selected paradigm and those that belong to other paradigms, e. g. zaplyv, 
which is a form of the verb (zaplyt’ ‘swim away; be swollen shut’) and the noun (zaplyv 
‘a swim’), see Table 5;

dver’mi ‘doors’), etc.  
4) graphically distinct ‘major’ and ‘second’ substantive cases and adjectival 
comparative forms (these forms have slightly different annotation according to the RNC 
standard, cf. Gen. sg. (bez) tolka and Gen 2. sg. (bez) tolku ‘no use (doing smth.)’; 
compar. silnej and compar. 2 posil’nej, compar. silnee and compar. 2 posilnee 
‘stronger’). 
4.4. Grammatical profiles in time and genres  
Information about the shifts in grammatical profiles over the time is given in 10-year 
intervals, and in the corpus of modern newspapers these time spans are narrowed to 1 
year. While the default dataset involves data from 1900 to 2010, the diachronic changes 
can be traced back to the 1800s. 
The user can also follow the shift of distributional properties in different collections: in 
literary prose, poetry, periodicals, everyday communication, research and teaching 
materials, in other genres of non-fiction, in electronic communication, and in oral non-
public speech. 
4.5. Units of measurement 
The user can choose one or several units to measure occurrences in the corpus: 
‒ a number of documents 
‒ an absolute frequency of occurrences (F.abs) and the total corpus size (absolute scale 
is required for further use in statistical toolkits) 
‒ a relative frequency in ipm (items per million) 
‒ a hierarchy (or a ranked list) of grammatical features like the following

Table 6. Grammatical profile of the noun vlijanie ‛impactʼ. Case distribution: absolute 
frequencies and percentage. 
The question what benchmark should be used as a basis for comparison (100%) is not 
that straightforward. This can be the total of all word form frequencies; however, the 
paradigm itself sometimes is not stable. For example, perfective and intransitive verbs 
systematically lack certain participles and gerunds, and the morphological shape of an 
imperfective verb determines whether it can form these peripheral forms, too. What is 
more, one can claim that participles and gerunds are not members of the verbal 
paradigm but form two separate (adjective-like and adverb-like) part of speech classes. 
Thus the stable part of the paradigm includes three basic moods: the infinitive, the 
indicative, and the imperative. Relative adjectives are prevented from forming the short 
forms and the comparative (and superlative) degree, so the core part of the adjectival 
paradigm includes the long forms only. Still, the ‘second’ cases should not be excluded 
from the totals as they occupy roughly the same syntactic position as the ‘major’ cases. 
The user determines which part of the paradigm is to be rated as 100 per cent.  
‒ form1:form2 ratio (the proportion of use of the two forms with respect to each other, 
see Table 7)

Table 7. Ratio of the active present participles to the passive past participles in a sample of 
verbs. 
‒ quintile scores of word forms (see Table 8)  
Quintile scores are categorical values that allow users to track profile patterns as 
compared to activity of the part of speech class. Table 8 shows the quintile scores for 
the semantic group of vehicles. Quintiles divide scores of all nouns in a particular case 
into five equal groups ranked from lowest (very rare, a) to highest (very frequent, e). 
For example, the frequency the dative forms of the noun parohod ‘steamboat’ is found 
in the lowest group 0% to 20% (a), the score of the accusative forms falls into the group 
 
10
20% to 40% (b), the score of the instrumental forms falls into the group 40% to 60% 
(c), etc.

4.6. Comparison of words and classes 
The data in the dictionary can be zoomed in and zoomed out to get a better view of 
trends in the lexical class and in the part of speech class. There are three levels of data 
representation. At the first level, the grammatical profiles of individual lexemes are 
presented; at the second level, the data are generalized into the profiles of lexico-
semantic classes (e. g. verbs of motion, names of instruments, etc.; cf. the RNC 
classification, http://ruscorpora.ru/en/corpora-sem.html); at the third level, information 
is given about the major lexical categories (e. g. relative adjectives, transitive verbs), 
part of speech classes and grammatical categories. 
 
5. Corpus data processing 
The main part of the dictionary is based on the corpus collection which spans from 1900 
to 2010. The diachronic part involves data starting from the 1800s. Data for the ‘small’ 
dictionary were collected in the RNC gold standard collection (5.4 million tokens) 
where lexico-grammatical homonymy was disambiguated manually. Data for the 
 
11
‘expanded’ version of the dictionary were taken from the main corpus, newspaper 
corpus, the corpus of poetry, and spoken corpus of the RNC (320 million words in 
total).  
First, the statistics of word forms were collected. The functional style and genre of each 
text, as well as time of creation was registered while processing the corpus. The 
database was indexed by lexical and grammar features (lemma, part of speech, 
inflectional attributes). We marked lexico-semantic classes according to the RNC 
classification; capitalized/non-capitalized and other variants of spelling. Second, we 
collected 2- and 3-gram statistics that shows the prepositional-case preferences of nouns 
and pronouns. 
The lists of 1) tokens that have more than one grammatical tagset (grammatically 
ambiguous forms) and 2) grammatical tagsets that correspond to more than one token 
(grammatical variants and distortions) were complied. Each case in (1) was marked as 
inter-paradigm or intra-paradigm homonymy. We assessed the reliability of 
grammatical annotation provided by the tagger. The disambiguated version of four 
corpora was created with the help of two programs - the light parser that relies on 
heuristics and the HMM module which is trained on the gold standard RNC collection. 
A subset of n-grams with conflicting annotation was further evaluated and corrected 
manually. 
The major problem for disambiguation tools was inherently overlapping paradigms, 
such as the paradigms of the masculine and feminine variants of the noun rojal’ ‘grand 
piano’ that share most of the forms and differ in the instrumental singular, cf. rojalem 
m. and rojal’ju f. The feminine variant was mostly used in the 19th c. and the 
contemporary dictionary built in the tagger does not include it. The form rojal’ju f. was 
detected as not-in-dictionary form and assigned the correct feminine tagset. At the same 
time, all plural forms got only masculine tagsets, and the dative and locative singular 
forms rojali got a masculine tagset with wrong gender, case and number attribution 
(nom. pl. or acc. pl.). Thus the dictionary contains the defective paradigm of the 
feminine noun rojal’ and the full paradigm of the masculine noun with overweighed 
proportion of plural forms. 
Another example is the adjectives zapásnyj ‘emergency’ (as in zapasnyj vyhod ‘back 
door’) and zapasnόj ‘reserve’ (as in zapasnoj igrok ‘reserve player’) which share most 
of the forms and partly share contexts and meaning. Both paradigms are stored in the 
tagger dictionary but their disambiguation is poor since the algorithm is not tuned to 
such a tiny difference (note that it is not always possible to choose the tagset manually).  
New approaches to disambiguation would solve the problem of overlapping paradigms 
in the future; in the pilot version of lexico-grammatical dictionary such cases are 
marked as ‘weakly reliable’. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The dictionary is addressed primarily to those who study and learn Russian grammar. It 
will be valuable to researchers interested in inflection and grammatical semantics, to 
editors and teachers who deal with grammatical variability. Nevertheless, it is 
noteworthy that the ‘lexico-centric’ approach, in spite of resource consumption and 
sparsity of data, proves to be helpful in natural language processing, too. As some 
recent experiments have shown, estimating the lexical probabilities can improve the 
results of HMM disambiguation module for Russian by 3% (Danilova et al. 2013). The 
online output of the dictionary can be freely downloaded in a spreadsheet format for 
further use in any kind of theoretical and practical activity.

The digital form of the dictionary allows us to continuously improve it. First, we are 
planning to develop the functionality to meet the linguistic community needs: to 
visualize graphically the data, to plug in external dictionaries, e. g. the dictionary of 
grammatical variants, the morphemes and word-formation dictionary, etc. Second, we 
will keep improving data quality as we collect users’ feedback and error reports and 
improve grammatical disambiguation of the RNC data. Third, we will evaluate 
inclusion of new data and new distributional patterns (one of them is a set of author 
attributes). This yields that data becomes more sparse, so work with small frequencies 
requires special care and handling techniques to avoid skewedness and extreme ratios. 
The main challenge though is to understand how to use the measures, how to interpret 
the data, how to transfer the obtained probabilities to other corpora and resources, and 
how to make accurate claims and predictions about functioning of inflectional forms in 
general. The proposed project is a first experiment in making a large lexico-grammatical 
reference resource and, therefore, it will afford a good material for studying the 
reliability of corpus data. There is no doubt that we need to better understand corpus 
data, the structure of corpora samples and how it is related to sustainability of the 
statistical data. We are to learn how to balance the samples of various time periods and 
genres, and the dictionary gives us a chance to experiment with rich lexical material so 
that adequacy of corpus data statistics would no longer be questioned.
